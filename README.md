# Panoramic Image Creation -SIFT and SURF
This repository is related to Computer Vision course purposes at ECE, DUTH.


In this project, I focused on creating a panoramic photo from four initial images using SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) and SURF (Speeded-up robust features) for feature detection and description. Additionally, I utilized the Image Composite Editor for result comparison. The process involved keypoint extraction, Manhattan distance calculation for feature matching, crossover method implementation for improved matching, homography matrix identification, and final image stitching to produce the panorama. This comprehensive approach enabled me to successfully merge the images into a seamless panorama, showcasing my skills in computer vision techniques and image processing.
